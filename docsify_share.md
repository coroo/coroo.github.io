Most of the time in the part of development in software application, you’ll need a documentation. It’s crucial to document your work, both for your sanity and to help others who want to learn your awesome resource.

However, creating online documentation can be a real pain. Thankfully, Docsify makes it easier by providing a free documentation generator running on Markdown. This is not a typical static site generator and it does not require static HTML/CSS pages. Instead, it loads Markdown files dynamically and displays them as web pages. Pretty neat!

It does require that you create the index.html file yourself, which can then be uploaded to GitHub Pages or hosted on your own server. From there, you just write Markdown files for each page and use those as your primary docs. The entire process is outlined in detail in the quick start guide, so that’s probably the best place to start. 

After you done doing some documentation with docsify, you need to have [docsify-share](https://coroo.github.io/docsify-share/#/). By using docsify-share, you or your viewer will be able to share your documentation easily. By using this package, I hope you can easily focus on your documentation and let your viewer share you package more easily.

Most of the time in the part of development in software application, users need to have an admin page to show multiple data and information such as sales performance, operation performance, etc. As one of PHP framework, laravel built an administrative panel called [Laravel Nova](https://nova.laravel.com/). Nova is a beautifully designed administration panel for Laravel. By using this tool, you can easily create and manage your admin panel of your website without having create it from scratch. The cool thing about Nova is it can be used for PHP or Vue.js because of Laravel compatibility. Hence it makes your admin panel can be flawless and writing custom components is a cinch.

Although laravel nova provided a cool admin panel, there is still no capable enough dashboard for me which can show me a data with more interactive information. Because of that, I try to built the package for Laravel Nova called [Nova ChartJS](https://coroo.github.io/nova-chartjs/#/).

By using my package, I hope that anyone can create their own chart easily. In this package, it provided many chart, e.g. [stacked chart](https://coroo.github.io/nova-chartjs/#/?id=stacked-chart), [bar chart](https://coroo.github.io/nova-chartjs/#/?id=bar-chart) and many more. Also it provided a simple configuration using default [laravel model](https://coroo.github.io/nova-chartjs/#/?id=use-laravel-model). You need to [show or hide a total amount in your chart](https://coroo.github.io/nova-chartjs/#/?id=hide-total) ? Add a [legend](https://coroo.github.io/nova-chartjs/#/?id=legend) ? or Add a [clickable chart](https://coroo.github.io/nova-chartjs/#/?id=clickable-point) ? Yes, this package is capable enough for you then. Also, you can always check a lot of another feature in Nova ChartJS. And if you think that this app is not capable enough for you to easing you create chart, don't be hestiate to ask me or [add ticket in here](https://github.com/coroo/nova-chartjs/issues). 

This package was first release in December 2019 and until now, its package already downloaded by [![Total Downloads](https://img.shields.io/packagist/dt/coroowicaksono/chart-js-integration)](https://packagist.org/packages/coroowicaksono/chart-js-integration) users and get [![Stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/coroo/nova-chartjs?style=social)](https://github.com/coroo/nova-chartjs/stargazers).
